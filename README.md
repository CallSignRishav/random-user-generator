This is a Random User Generator that generates random users with their profile picture, names, email, contact, etc.

Also, I added a Refetch button to refetch the data from the API.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Second, you can build the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Third, you can start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API Routes

I'm using Random [https://randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me) API to generate random users.
